### 1. Enter your project directory.

```zsh
cd project
```

Of course, your project name will be different from mine, but throughout this guide I will use ```project``` anytime I am referring to the project root.

### 2. Create a virtual environment for your project.

```zsh
python -m venv env
```

```env``` is what I usually use, but you can choose whatever name you want or need. Throughout this guide, ```env``` will be used as the virtual environment.
